# Hate-speech-and-offensive-language-detection-using-ML

This project aims to address the growing problem of hate speech, offensive language and  cyberbullying on social media platforms, which can have been linked to serious negative impacts on mental health. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that detects and flags comments or posts containing such language before they are posted or shared publicly. On top of that, it unique uses Google AI  which enables the model to further suggest alternative, non-offensive phrasing that the user can choose to use instead, in case a comment or post is flagged. This is to encourage more respectful and constructive dialogue in social media platforms.
